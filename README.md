## Moisture-tracker IOT

This is one of three repos for a project that I wrote at a course at Linnaeus University where I use a thing, a sensor that measures the mositure level in a plant and publish that data via a MQTT broker that a backend server is listening too. A frontend is displaying the values.
This is the repo for the thing, the sensor that is collecting the mositure and is written in MicroPython.
